# Bollywood_celebrity_predictor
🎬 Bollywood Celebrity Predictor
A Deep Learning and Computer Vision project that predicts which Bollywood celebrity you resemble the most.
This project combines *face detection, **feature extraction, and *similarity matching techniques to deliver accurate and fun results.

Built with *TensorFlow/Keras, **VGGFace (ResNet50), **MTCNN, **OpenCV, and a *Streamlit UI, this project demonstrates how pre-trained models can be applied to solve real-world face recognition tasks.

✨ Project Overview
Have you ever wondered which Bollywood celebrity you look like?
This project allows you to upload your picture, detects your face, extracts facial embeddings using VGGFace, and then compares them with embeddings of Bollywood celebrity images stored in the dataset.

The closest match is returned along with the celebrity's image.

🔑 Key Concepts Used:

*Face Detection: Using *MTCNN to locate the face in an image.
*Feature Extraction: Using *VGGFace (ResNet50) without the top layer, trained on large face datasets.
Cosine Similarity: Measuring similarity between extracted embeddings and stored celebrity embeddings.
*Interactive App: Built with *Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
